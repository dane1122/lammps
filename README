This is the LAMMPS software package.

EMSCRIPTEN BUILD GUIDE

1. Get Emscripten: https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
2. Clone or download LAMMPS source code from 'stable' branch and 'cd' into the 'src' directory
4. emmake make mpi-stubs

6. emmake make yes-USER-MOLFILE
7. 'emmake make emcc-serial mode=shlib' to build lammps
8. Verify that 'liblammps.bc' and 'liblammps_emcc_serial.bc' libraries are create
9. see README in 'web' directory for compiling into web assembly
